#Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
# Input: prices[] = {7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4}
# Output: 5
# Explanation:
# The lowest price of the stock is on the 2nd day, i.e. price = 1. Starting from the 2nd day, the highest price of the stock is witnessed on the 5th day, i.e. price = 6. 
# Therefore, maximum possible profit = 6 â€“ 1 = 5.
